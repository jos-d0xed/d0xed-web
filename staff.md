Network Staff
===========

JoS
-------
   JoS started off the network with a group of fellow Sysadmins in 2009. It was a way for all of them to keep in touch throughout the day. Initially run from a Mini-ITX box in his lounge room, the network has now grown to a larger operation with greater diversity.

   *Responsible for:*

   * All services operations
   * Rasputin (IRC + services box)
   * Initial node configurations and linking

*Contact:*

   * JoS on IRC (obviously)
   * jeremy ::at-symbol:: d0xed.com
   * GPG key A7E5 738C AB8B 0CF9 3D36  A32B 6EF2 50FF E8AF 29C3

   * [@d0xed_irc](https://twitter.com/d0xed_irc)

Jarvis
-------
  Jarvis has been with d0xed since its beginning in 2009.  Now responsible for the Zeus node, Jarvis spends most of his days on Reddit and in #banterpod.  Please excuse him if he comes across blunt sometimes; his service as a Sysadmin / Netadmin has caused him to lose faith in humanity.

   *Responsible for:*

   * Zeus node (currently out of commission)
   * All services operations
   * IRCop across all servers

Himiko
------
  Himiko is our newest and youngest staff member. He doesn't know how to z-line yet, but be warned - once he does, the network will be his! P.S. Don't tell JoS.

  *Responsible for:*

  * Absolutely nothing (but secretly is a services operator)
  
*Contact:*

  * Himiko on IRC (PM him)
  * IP over Avian Carriers (IPoAC)



Alumni
========

Zalami
-----
  Zalami was a valued member of the d0xed IRC network for many years, but unfortunately real life responsibilities have stolen him away from us.

Dude
------
  Dude was one of our founding members, who has unfortunately succumbed to the time demands of fatherhood. Maybe we'll see him back in a few years when his children have all grown up.
