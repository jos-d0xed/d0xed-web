Contacting Staff
===============

There may come a time when you need to contact a member of the d0xed network staff.  The d0xed staff prefer if you contact them through MemoServ (which is an IRC service).  Details on how to use MemoServ can be accessed by [clicking here](services.md#MemoServ).

Please remember to take into account timezones when contacting a member of staff.  They are all volunteers from different timezones, and as such, may not be connected to IRC when you message them (of course, they'll read it when they're next online).

Some staff have extra contact details on the [staff](staff.md) page.
