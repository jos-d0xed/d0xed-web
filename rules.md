Network Rules
=============

As with any network open to the public, there are several rules that must be followed to ensure an active and respectful community.

Rule # 1: This is not a democracy!
---------------------------------

The staff of the d0xed network collaboratively run and manage all services this network provides.  They are all volunteers with no staff receiving any income from the operation of this network.  Therefore, staff decisions are final (as much as we'll try to make fair and balanced decisions).

The staff also reserve the right to close any channel that is associated with, but not limited to, terroism, child exploitation, pornography, distribution of illegal content, etc.  If the staff believe that your channel is inappropriate for the general public, we will contact the channel owner directly to work for an amicable resolution. If we cannot reach an acceptable resolution, then a staff decision will be made.

Rule # 2: Respect!
-----------------

Strongly offensive language will not be tolerated under any circumstances.  A breach of this rule will result in a warning the first time.  Repeat offenders will find themselves potentially banned from this community.

Remember, everyone is entitled to an opinion.  If you disagree with another user, you are welcome to voice your concerns.  Just do so in a way that is not offensive to the user, or anyone else in the channel.

Rule # 3: SPAM and flooding
---------------------------

SPAM will not be tolerated under any circumstances.  Spammers will be banned immediately.

There is automated flood protection enabled on this network.  You can send up to 10 messages within 5 seconds before you will be kicked from the channel for flooding. This can be set on a per-channel basis, so if a particular community member wants a spam/flooding channel, then that's totally fine with us (as long as it doesn't impact the function of the network).

Rule # 4: Channel ownership
--------------------------

Channel owner rights are assigned to the nick which creates the channel.  If you do create a channel, please remember to register it with ChanServ to allow proper management.  You can find out more about services by [clicking here](services.md).

As the channel owner, you are responsible to ensure that the channel name and topic do not cause offense to the majority of d0xed users.  Any complaints will be reviewed individually by the staff and the appropriate action taken if we deem necessary.
