About the Network
=======

What is the d0xed.com IRC network?
----------
The d0xed.com IRC network is a small IRC network run by volunteers who have dedicated their time and servers to create a privacy-focused service available to anyone who wishes to use it.

Who is the network for?
----------
At this time, it is predominantly used by the privacy-conscious, and IT-literate folks (due to the grassroots of the network). However, the network is open for anyone and everyone who wishes to use it.

How can I get access?
