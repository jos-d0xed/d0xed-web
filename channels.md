\#banterpod
------

   \#banterpod is a general chat room - no real formal topic enforcement. However, a large percentage of users are either Sysadmins, Netadmins, InfoSec professionals, or programmers, so the conversation does tend more towards the technical a lot of the time. We're a friendly bunch though, so drop on by and say hello!

\#ebola
-----
   \#ebola is a fresh and relatively small channel dedicated to discussing and tracking our impending doom from the Ebola Virus. Some of us are working towards an EbolaBot to regularly report on emerging news articles, and track the outbreak as it develops.

\#slaveryreport
-----
   Slavery Report is a nonprofit organization designed to maximize reporting and organize cooperative extraction operations worldwide to combat Human Trafficking. This channel serves as a means to allow tactical and technical officers to communicate securely regardless of their location or environment.
