Contributing
========

Contributions are primarily sought at the moment in 2 realms

   * Assistance in moderation
   * Inviting new users

Secondary contributions, which are lesser-needed at this stage, include

   * Servers for the network
   * Financial contributions
   
Whilst these are always helpful, they are largely covered for the moment. Anyone willing to contribute is can contact one of the staff via IRC, and users are expected to be active and respected members of the community. If there are any security issues that need reporting, please report them directly to the server administrator.
